# First-Portfolio
This was my first exercise in using CSS and HTML together to form a web app.
I learned how to add an image to HTML that was stored on my computer. It took 2 hours and several different people to look at it before I was able to figure it out.
I also now understand more about local repositories vs. remote repositories and how they work together. 
The goal of this site is to have a simple page for anyone to visit to learn a little more about me and have links to my Github, LinkedIn, Instagram. I also wanted them to be able to contact me.
