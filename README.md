# First-Portfolio
This was my first exercise in using CSS and HTML together to form a web app.
Deployed Application: Â https://leah-choco.github.io/First-Portfolio/

## The Goal of This Project
The goal of this application is to have a place for people to check out to get to know me, my work, and have my contact information. 

## Project Requirements:
I was asked to create a portfolio. It must include a short biography, a section displaying my work (right now this includes placeholders as I currently do not have anything else I have created) and contact information. I was also asked to include a navigation bar and make it responsive. 

## What I Learned:
The first thing I learned was adding images into my local repository. I first made the mistake of adding it into my Github. 
I pushed myself to work with grid. While I am not totally satisfied, I did learn more about it. 

### What I Need to Work on:
I need to get more proficient in reponsive design. I do not believe that I was totally able to satify that requirement of the challenge. I am absolutely willing to continue to learn and resubmit this project.
